Hello, thanks for checking out my Case Study #1!

Executive Summary:
We set out to identify the top 3 factors of attrition at Frito-Lay and to generate a predictive model based on those factors. 

I settled on Monthly Income, Age, and Overtime as the top 3 factors. We found a strong correlation with attrition and the sales representative, HR, research scientist, and lab technician positions. 

My naive bayes model had Accuracy​ of 83.33%; Sensitivity​ of 87.26%; Specificity ​of 62.86%.
